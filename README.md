# Helm Chart for blocky

Fork of the blocky helm chart that was included in the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts.git) repository, which unfortunately is no longer maintained.

Some basic usage instructions can be found in the chart's [README](charts/blocky/README.md).

The detailled explanation on how to use it will follow, once it is finished...
